## 1. Introduction

**PlankDB** is an experimental quantum key-value database (search-oriented) implemented in Java, featuring a REST API for user interaction.

The main highlight of PlankDB is the integration of Java code with quantum search. When a search request is performed, PlankDB may invoke the Grover algorithm on a quantum emulator or on real quantum hardware (via IBM Qiskit Runtime).

Conceptually, the `QuantumMap` object behaves like a regular `Map`, but during lookup operations it switches to quantum mode, reflecting the demonstration purpose of the project.

Although PlankDB implements the `Map<Key, Value>` interface, the underlying search is not hash-based. This is not a true hash map, but rather an abstract unsorted collection, over which quantum selection is applied.

### 📊 Search Complexity Comparison

| 🧠 Search Method           | ⏱️ Average Complexity |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| `HashMap` (key-based)     | **O(1)**               |
| Classical linear search   | **O(n)**               |
| Quantum search (Grover)   | **O(√n)**              |

Thus, PlankDB demonstrates the properties and limitations of applying Grover's quantum search algorithm to unstructured data.

Additionally, PlankDB showcases how classical programming environments (such as Java) may interact with quantum computing systems. In the near future, we may expect a variety of integration scenarios:

- Invoking quantum workloads through REST APIs in the cloud (as in this project);
- Direct connections to on-premises quantum hardware;
- Embedding provider-specific SDKs into mainstream languages (including JVM-based languages);
- Transparent switching to quantum mode triggered by data scale or query complexity.

PlankDB represents a prototype for what practical quantum search integration could look like, and it provides a starting point for the broader discussion about future standards of interoperability between classical and quantum computing platforms.

## 2. Project Overview

PlankDB is intended to be launched and tested via **Docker**. Although local builds are technically possible, the project has only been fully tested within Docker containers.

### 🔧 Quick Start with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swampus/plank-db.git
cd plank-db

docker compose build
docker compose up
```

This will launch the service and expose the API on port `8080`.

> 🔁 Alternatively, you can also use classic Docker CLI:
>
```bash
docker build -t plankdb .
docker run -p 8080:8080 plankdb
```

### 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `web/` – Spring Boot REST API layer
- `application/` – business logic layer
- `domain/` – core interfaces and models
- `infrastructure/` – integration services and runners
- `python/` – Python scripts for both local simulation and IBM Quantum execution
    - `grover.py`, `grover_range.py` – for local backend
    - `grover_ibm.py`, `grover_range_ibm.py` – for IBM Quantum

### 💡 Local Usage (not officially tested)

To run PlankDB locally:
- Ensure you have Java 17+ and Python 3.10+ installed
- Install [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) in a virtual environment
- Run backend scripts from `scripts/` folder manually if needed
- Edit `application.yml` for local configuration
- Launch via `mvn spring-boot:run`

**Note**: Quantum integration is triggered through subprocess-based execution of Qiskit scripts, and may require additional setup.

### 🌐 Cloud Execution (IBM Qiskit Runtime)

PlankDB supports execution on IBM's real quantum devices via [IBM Quantum Runtime](https://quantum.ibm.com/lab). To use this mode:

1. Register at: https://quantum.ibm.com
2. Generate your API token in your [account settings](https://quantum.ibm.com/account)
3. Enable billing with a credit card (for real-device access)
4. Set the following environment variables (or use the provided `.env` file):

```bash
export QUANTUM_EXECUTION_MODE=IBM
export QUANTUM_IBM_TOKEN=your_ibm_token
```

These variables allow switching between local simulation and IBM Quantum cloud execution. The values will be used automatically if placed in a `.env` file in the project root.

### 🔗 REST API and Swagger UI

PlankDB exposes a RESTful HTTP API available on port `8080`.  
For full interactive documentation and testing, use the Swagger UI:

➡️ [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

Key endpoints include:

- `POST /collections/{collection}/put` — insert a key-value pair
- `GET /collections/{collection}/search/{key}` — perform **Grover-based quantum search**h**

Each endpoint is documented in the Swagger UI, including:
- request/response examples
- quantum-specific result fields like `confidence_score` or `execution_time_ms`
- descriptions of fallback behavior if quantum execution is unavailable

This API is suitable for both classical usage and quantum-enabled applications.

## 3. Architecture and Code Structure

PlankDB follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, promoting clear separation of concerns and independence between layers. This structure improves testability, modularity, and long-term maintainability — essential qualities for both experimental and production-grade systems.

### 🧱 Package Structure Overview

The project is organized into the following core packages:

- `domain/`  
  Defines core domain interfaces and abstract models.  
  It is independent of frameworks and contains no external dependencies.

- `application/`  
  Contains use cases that encapsulate the business logic of the system.  
  These use cases coordinate domain interfaces and serve as the heart of the application logic.

- `infrastructure/`  
  Implements interaction with external systems such as Python quantum scripts, file runners, and environment configuration.  
  This layer acts as the adapter between the core logic and the outside world.

- `web/`  
  Provides the REST API using Spring Boot.  
  It exposes endpoints for interacting with collections, performing quantum and range queries, and integrates with the application layer via dependency injection.

- `python/`  
  Contains executable Python scripts that implement Grover’s algorithm for both local and IBM Quantum backends.  
  These scripts are invoked by the infrastructure layer and return quantum search results back to the application.

### 🧩 Why Clean Architecture?

This approach is chosen because it:

- Enables isolated testing of logic without reliance on HTTP or Python dependencies
- Makes it easy to swap or extend quantum execution backends (e.g., simulator vs. real hardware)
- Encourages long-term separation of interface and implementation
- Supports both demonstration and research-level experimentation

The modular layout ensures that PlankDB remains flexible and maintainable, even as quantum technologies evolve.

### 🧠 Dependency Inversion in Practice

PlankDB adheres to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** — a core part of Clean Architecture — by organizing dependencies around abstractions:

- The `application/` and `domain/` layers depend only on interfaces, never on concrete implementations.
- Quantum execution interfaces are declared in the domain layer, while real implementations (e.g. Python script runners) reside in `infrastructure/`.
- The REST API in `web/` interacts only with the application layer, unaware of how quantum execution is actually performed.

This design makes it easy to:
- Swap quantum backends (e.g., switch from local simulation to IBM hardware)
- Test the application logic in isolation (using mocks or stubs)
- Maintain long-term separation between business logic and technical concerns

By inverting dependencies and structuring around use cases, PlankDB remains flexible, extendable, and robust against changes in technology or platform.

### 4.1 Quantum Superposition: The Theoretical Basis

At the heart of quantum computing lies the concept of **superposition** — a fundamental difference from classical computation.

In classical systems, a bit can be either `0` or `1`.  
In quantum systems, a **qubit** can be in a **superposition** of both `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` states simultaneously:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

Where:
- `α` and `β` are complex amplitudes,
- |α|² + |β|² = 1,
- The square of the amplitude gives the **probability** of observing that state upon measurement.

When you measure the qubit, the superposition collapses into either `0` or `1` — but until measurement, the system evolves as a combination of both.

In multi-qubit systems, superposition enables a system of `n` qubits to represent `2ⁿ` possible states **simultaneously**.  
This exponential parallelism is what makes quantum algorithms — like Grover’s — so powerful.

For example, with 5 qubits we can simultaneously explore 32 different states.

This is not parallel computing in the classical sense — rather, it’s a **probabilistic amplitude evolution** governed by linear algebra over Hilbert space.

In PlankDB, this principle is simulated by running Grover’s algorithm over a space of binary-encoded keys.  
Each possible key is mapped to a quantum state in superposition, and the oracle function is used to mark the correct state, increasing its measurement probability.

---

### 4.2 Grover's Algorithm Explained

Grover's algorithm allows searching an unsorted list of `N` items in approximately **√N** steps — a quadratic speedup over classical search.

Key steps:

1. **Initialization** — Create an equal superposition over all states
2. **Oracle** — Mark the correct state by inverting its amplitude
3. **Diffusion operator** — Reflect the state vector around the average
4. **Repeat** — Run this process √N times

The amplitude of the marked state increases with each iteration.  
After a few iterations, a measurement is likely to return the correct state.

This algorithm is implemented using Qiskit circuits — either locally (Aer simulator) or remotely (IBM Quantum Runtime).

---

### 4.3 How PlankDB Uses Grover

In PlankDB, both `search` and `range` operations rely on Grover's algorithm:

- A collection of keys is loaded into a Python script and encoded as binary
- An oracle circuit is constructed based on the key or range condition
- Grover's algorithm is run to amplify the matching state
- The result is decoded and returned to the Java API

This is not efficient for production — O(n) time to prepare the state — but is ideal for demonstration purposes.

---

### 4.4 Probabilistic Nature of Quantum Results

Quantum search results are inherently **probabilistic** — a correct answer is likely, but not guaranteed.

PlankDB returns a rich result object:

```json
{
  "quantum_result": {
    "matched_key": "0101",
    "matched_value": "example",
    "matched_index": 5,
    "top_measurement": "0101",
    "oracle_expression": "key == 0101",
    "num_qubits": 4,
    "confidence_score": 0.91,
    "execution_time_ms": 84,
    "oracle_depth": 8,
    "iterations": 3
  },
  "scientific_notes": {
    "principle": "Grover amplification",
    "theory": "oracle-based selection in Hilbert space",
    "circuit_behavior": "amplitude modulation",
    "confidence_interpretation": "non-deterministic probability outcome",
    "qubit_commentary": "n qubits encode 2^n states",
    "encoding_map": {
      "0000": "a",
      "0001": "b"
    },
    "used_iterations": 3
  }
}
```

This DTO (`QuantumResultDTO`) includes both raw results and scientific context for interpretability.

### 4.5 When Will Quantum Search Matter?

Grover's algorithm provides meaningful advantage when:

- The dataset is large (thousands to millions of records)
- Search is performed repeatedly over static data
- Quantum memory (QRAM) becomes practical

Today, these conditions are not met — data loading is classical and overhead is high.

However, PlankDB provides a useful demonstration of how such systems **could** work — and what real-world Java–quantum integration might eventually look like.

## 5. Limitations and Practical Considerations

While PlankDB demonstrates the principles of quantum search in a practical Java-based application, it is subject to several real-world limitations that must be considered.

### 🚧 Not Production-Ready
- PlankDB is a **prototype** — designed for learning, demonstration, and experimentation
- The system is **not optimized for performance or concurrency**
- It does **not persist data** beyond runtime (in-memory only)
- No authentication, rate limiting, or production deployment support is included

### 🐌 Classical Bottlenecks
Although Grover’s algorithm runs in `O(√n)` time, preparing the data for quantum execution still requires:
- **O(n)** time to load the collection into memory
- Binary encoding and serialization of keys to pass to the Python script
- Subprocess overhead for spawning Python (especially on Windows)
  These factors **negate the quantum speedup** for small or medium-sized datasets.

### 🧠 Quantum Hardware Constraints
- IBM Quantum has **limited availability**, even with billing
- Circuit depth, qubit decoherence, and queue time significantly affect results
- Noise can corrupt outputs unless error mitigation is applied
  For these reasons, PlankDB primarily runs on **local simulation (Qiskit Aer)** during development.

### 🔬 Probabilistic Output and Confidence
Quantum results are **non-deterministic**:
- A query may return the wrong key with small probability
- PlankDB includes a `confidence_score` field to represent the likelihood of correctness
- Repeated runs improve reliability but increase cost on real quantum hardware

### 📊 Search Suitability Criteria

Grover's search is ideal when:

| Factor                          | Classical Search | Quantum Grover |
|---------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Large datasets (n > 10,000)     | ❌ Slower        | ✅ Scales better |
| Small collections               | ✅ Fast          | ❌ Overhead too high |
| Multiple queries on static data | ❌ Repeated scans| ✅ Amortized |
| Fast answer required            | ✅ Deterministic | ❌ Probabilistic |

### 🧭 Future Outlook
As quantum hardware matures and **QRAM** becomes available, systems like PlankDB could:
- Eliminate the O(n) classical loading bottleneck
- Perform batch queries and filtering entirely in quantum space
- Integrate deeper with Java or Kotlin through native quantum SDKs

Until then, PlankDB remains a valuable **educational and architectural prototype** for quantum-enhanced search systems.
